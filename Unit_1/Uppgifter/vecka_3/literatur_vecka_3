Methods for File Recovery in Windows Client:

Check the Recycle Bin:

The first and simplest step is to check the Recycle Bin. Deleted files are usually moved here, and you can easily restore them to their original location.
Use File History (if enabled):

If you have File History enabled, it creates regular backups of your files. You can use it to restore previous versions or deleted files.
Troubleshooting Tip: If File History isn't working, check its settings, ensure the backup drive is connected, and troubleshoot any potential errors in the Event Viewer.
Use Windows File Recovery tool (for recent deletions):

Windows File Recovery is a command-line tool that can recover recently deleted files from various storage devices.
Troubleshooting Tip: This tool is most effective for recent deletions and may not be successful for older files or heavily fragmented drives.
Use third-party data recovery software:

There are numerous third-party data recovery tools available, both free and paid. These tools can often recover files even after they've been deleted from the Recycle Bin or if File History wasn't enabled.
Troubleshooting Tip: Choose reputable software and be cautious about downloading from unknown sources. Research reviews and compatibility with your Windows version.
General Tips for File Recovery:

Act quickly: The sooner you attempt recovery after a file is deleted, the higher the chances of success.
Minimize disk activity: Avoid writing new data to the drive where the deleted files were located. This reduces the risk of overwriting the deleted data.
Consider professional help: If the data is critical and you're unable to recover it yourself, consider seeking professional data recovery services.
MD-100 Troubleshooting Mindset for File Recovery:

Identify the problem: Determine how the files were lost (accidental deletion, drive formatting, etc.).
Gather information: Check the Recycle Bin, File History settings, and any error messages.
Analyze and choose a solution: Based on the information gathered, choose the most appropriate recovery method.
Test and implement: Try the chosen method and, if successful, restore the files to a safe location.
Document: Keep a record of the recovery process and any lessons learned for future reference.
Remember, file recovery is not always guaranteed, and success depends on various factors. However, by employing a systematic approach and utilizing the appropriate tools, you can increase your chances of recovering lost files.
